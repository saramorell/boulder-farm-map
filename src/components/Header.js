                  Early on, Boulder’s residents made clear a deep love
                  for their land. In 1967, Boulder became the first city
                  in the United States to tax itself for funds to be used
                  specifically for the acquisition and management of
                  open space. Around the same time, countywide
                  residents approved the use of public lands for
                  agriculture, seeing value in the care and use of public
                  land by farmers. Today, about 25,000 acres of the
                  county’s public lands are leased to farmers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  An even broader agricultural industry feeds
                  Boulder’s obsession with fresh foods and its
                  outdoor-loving ethos. There are over 850 farms
                  in Boulder County! This brochure is devoted to a
                  number of those farms that welcome visitors on
                  a regular basis.

                  It’s our hope you’ll get out and meet our
                  extraordinary farming community, feel the cool
                  Colorado sunshine on your skin, swing on a tire
                  swing, let a handful of juicy raspberries drip down
                  your chin — and see for yourself why Boulderites
                  are so passionate about our land and the foods
                  that come from it.
